The goal of this project was to analyze and compare different classification models to predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan based on demographic and financial attributes. Using a dataset of 5,000 Universal Bank customers, I first built a decision tree using the CART methodology, evaluating its splitting criteria, accuracy, and decision rules. Next, I used ensemble methodsâ€”including Bagging, Boosting, and Random Forest, and applied to determine if they improve classification performance over the CART model. The accuracy and misclassification rates of each approach are compared to identify the most effective model. Finally, I used the best-performing model to predict whether a hypothetical customer, Caroline, would accept a personal loan based on her profile. The project ultimately helps the bank optimize its target marketing strategy by identifying key factors influencing loan acceptance.
